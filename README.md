# Kesari-Tours-and-Travels-Booking
I am thrilled that I have finally completed my first task of my Internship at Octanet designing a portfolio landing website using .html, .css, and .js java script technologies. I designed a website of booking tickets for tours and travels by airways.I implemented this by using bootstrap and owl carousel front end frameworks.
In this project ,I will introduce about my website using html,css,js,bootsrtap,owl-carousel technologies and framworks etc.
Basically HTML is the standard markup language for creating websites and CSS is the language that describes the style of an HTML document.
We will combine HTML and CSS to create a basic Travels website.
I used the codings in the above files first creating index.html,main.js and plugins.js.
The other files consist of codings of bootstrap ,owl carousel and font awsome frameworks from their orginal websites and I implemented them in the website.
he HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

CSS : Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
